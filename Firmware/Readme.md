The firmware changes required for a Hemera upgrade to function normaly have been started. <br>

To create the firmware for your printer you will need to compile it yourself. <br>
I used the Arduino IDE version 1.8.5 <br>

For more detail please read the Prusa github explanation : <br>
https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/README.md <br>

This firmware is based on Prusa firmware version : 3.2.3 <br>
This is the last firmware Prusa released for the Mk2(s) <br>

This firmware has only been created for the Rambo 1.3 board <br>
