The firmware changes required for a Hemera upgrade to function normaly have been started.

To create the firmware for your printer you will need to compile it yourself.
I used the Arduino IDE version 1.8.5

For more detail please read the Prusa github explanation : 
https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/README.md

This firmware is based on Prusa firmware version : 3.2.3
This is the last firmware Prusa released for the Mk2(s)

This firmware has only been created for the Rambo 1.3 board
