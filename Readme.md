This is an improved mounting plate for the E3D-online Hemera hotend / extruder.

Their original mounting plate (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4057169) 
Did not have a good mounting for the Pinda probe.
So I modified their mounting plate to this improved version.

Improvements : 
Pinda mounting is now done with 2x 8mm low profile nuts.
After this I noticed that the firmware changes E3D mention are not enough.

So I also worked on a new firmware based on Prusa's latest firmware version for the Mk2
