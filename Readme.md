This is an improved mounting plate for the E3D-online Hemera hotend / extruder. <br>

Their original mounting plate <br>

Did not have a good mounting for the Pinda probe. <br>
So I modified their mounting plate to this improved version. <br>

Improvements : <br>
Pinda mounting is now done with 2x 8mm low profile nuts. <br>
This allows for better adjustability and a more secure mounting. <br>

After this I noticed that the firmware changes E3D mention are not enough. <br>
So I also worked on a new firmware based on Prusa's latest firmware version for the Mk2(s) <br>
